                        I am an undergraduate Aerospace Engineering student at The University of Bath who is passionate about solving problems and finding innovative solutions through individual work and teamwork. With particular interests in motorsport, aviation and the space sector from a young age, I found that aerospace engineering best fitted me. Since then I have been involved in a variety of engineering competitions ranging from F1InSchools to model rocketry. I enjoy randomly designing things on 3D modelling softwares such as AutoDesk Inventor and 3DExperience CATIA which I have recently picked up.

                        <h3>3D printed RC Car</h3>
                        <p>
                           Over the summer, I designed and built a 3D printed RC car using only a pre-designed base chassis. The entire design phase consisting of the design of both the suspension and transmission took approximately 2 months. A working prototype was produced by the end of August. The filament for the chassis, suspension and transmission was PLA whilst 95A TPU was used for the drive shafts to introduce torque damping. The final weight of the RC model was approximately 95% of that of the initial design. Generative shape design was used to reduce weight where possible.

                            As part of our 'Modelling Techniques' module, we were tasked with calculating and visualising the angle required to reach a certain apogee given initial values. The extensions for this assignment was open ended, as such, I decided to use my knowledge of spacecraft manoeuvres and orbital mechanics to visualise the trajectories of a satellite whilst considering orbital decay, transfer manoeuvres and more. The Runge-Kutta method and built in stiff ODE solvers such as ode15s were used to calculate the next positions of the spacecraft.

            <h3>Snowmobile shaft design</h3>
            <p>
                A shaft that adheres to constraints was designed for a snowmobile. Loading cases were analysed from free body diagrams to understand the forces at each section of the shaft. To minimise chances of component and sub-component failure, safety factors and other values attributing to component interactions were calculated. To ensure that the drive shaft worked when under loading, deflection was calculated. In addition, minimising weight was done through calculating the ideal diameter at each section due to the load applied and rounding up to the nearest value of the standard inner diameters of bearings sold.
